# staged

Staged compilation with two-level type theory. 

This is a system for two-stage compilation with full dependent types at both stages; as far as I know, the first such system.

- [Preprint](https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/AndrasKovacs.github.io/tree/master/pdfs/2ltt.pdf). Includes a proof of correctness of staging.
- [Demo implementation](demo), together with a tutorial and some code examples. Has an efficient staging implementation and powerful inference for stage annotations.

Older material, somewhat obsolete now:

- [Abstract at the TYPES 2021 conference](https://types21.liacs.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/book.pdf#page=83).
- [Slightly longer abstract, discussing generativity](efop_abstract/ext_abstract.pdf).
