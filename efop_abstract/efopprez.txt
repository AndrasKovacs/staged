Staged compilation & generativity

------------------------------------------------------------

Staged compilation:

- programs which generate programs
- AST + string manipulation
  - issue: no guarantee of correctness, variables + scoping + substitutions

- Staging:
  - system: - guaranteed well-typing of output
            - don't have to care scope + name handling
	    - nice integration between object and meta-level syntax

Rules for staging (two-level type theory (2LTT))

  Universes: U₀ (object-level), U₁ (meta-level types)

  (A : U₀)     then    ↑A : U₁         (taking type of "Code", "Exp")
  t : A : U₀   then   <t> : ↑A         (quoting)
  t : ↑A       then   ~t  : A          (splicing)

  <~t>   = t
  ~(<t>) = t

id : (A : ↑U₀) → ↑(~A → ~A)     (specialized id function for every type)
id = λ A. <λ x. x>

------------------------------------------------------------

- generativity : property of staging system

   inspect ↑A  : non-generative

- question: what about generative/non-generative features in semantics?

  semantics: presheaf model
    f : ↑Bool₀ → ↑Bool₀

    for example: decidable equality of ↑A:
        (t u : ↑A) → Dec (t = u)   ?

    depends on the object theory:

       substitutions in obj theory: inequality of expressions is not stable under subst
          x /= y      --->    (x /= y)[x ↦ t, y ↦ t]   (not stable!)

       weakenings in obj theory: OK

       axiom: countability of expressions:

           ∀ A. there is is an injection : ↑A → ℕ



























































------------------------------------------------------------

Staged compilation
  - stability under X : we don't have to write X-es

2LTT
  - syntax examples
  - presheaf model: simplest justification of metaprogramming view
    (natural functions in constructive metalanguage)
  - Yoneda Lemma for contexts
    - "External parametricity" from Yoneda

  - generativity
    - non-generative features:
      - stability under substitution
      - stability under weakening ("hygienic macros")
        - How to get around yoneda lemma: y does not preserve products/extension
	- what's the inner theory with weakening?

    (univalent transport, external parametricity?)
