CLF extends the Linear Logical Framework to allow the natural representation of concurrent computations in an object language. The underlying type theory uses monadic types to segregate values from computations. This separation leads to a tractable notion of definitional equality that identifies computations differing only in the order of execution of independent steps. From a logical point of view our type theory can be seen as a novel combination of lax logic and dual intuitionistic linear logic. An encoding of a small Petri net exemplifies the representation methodology, which can be summarized as  ‚Äù  concurrent computations as monadic expressions‚Äù.}},

These can   be used to give a formal treatment of data types with laws as has   been discussed by David Turner in his earliest papers on Miranda   [Turner(1985)]. The non-dependent elimination scheme is particularly   useful for defining functions by recursion and pattern matching,   while the dependent elimination scheme gives an induction proof   principle. We have rules for non-recursive higher inductive types,   like the integers, but also for recursive higher inductive types   like the truncation. In the present paper we only allow path   constructors (so there are no higher path constructors), which is   sufficient for treating various interesting examples from functional   programming, as we will briefly show in the paper: arithmetic   modulo, integers and finite sets.",

abstract="Inductive-inductive types are a joint generalization of mutual inductive types and indexed inductive types. In extensional type theory, inductive-inductive types can be constructed from inductive types, and this construction has been conjectured to work in intensional type theory as well. In this paper, we show that the existing construction requires Uniqueness of Identity Proofs, and present a new construction (which we conjecture generalizes) of one particular inductive-inductive type in cubical type theory, which is compatible with homotopy type theory.",

We present Quick Look, a practical, implemented, and deployable design for impredicative type inference. To demonstrate our claims, we have modified GHC, a production-quality Haskell compiler, to support impredicativity.¬† The changes required are modest, localised, and are fully compatible with GHC's myriad other type system extensions.},
