- No stage ambiguity possible, explicit runtime vs meta let-defs
- Coercive subtyping
- Input program is a single runtime expression
- Don't print inserted meta spines.
- Specialize printing for top-level let-s and lambdas
- options:
  - elab
  - stage
  - nf
  + toggleable implicit printing in all cases
    - implicits on  prints meta solution + implicit lambda/app
    - implicits off prints none of that

- have docs
