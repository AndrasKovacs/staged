# rtcg

Runtime code generation with dependent types. Planned features:

- Type-in-type, dependent functions, Agda-style implicits and inference.
- Runtime code generation.
- Full scope and type safety.
- Cross-stage persistent top-level definitions.
- A monad with basic IO and mutable references.
- A Haskell reference interpreter.
- A javascript backend using native JIT.
