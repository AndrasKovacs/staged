- Don't compute Closed in closure conversion! Just lift the lambdas.
- Instead, insert Closed/CSP when generating code from cconv-ed code!
  Add variable closed-ness tracking to codegen!
  - Open closures have open capture and open args!
    When building an open closure in closed code, box everything up


Extras:
  - definitional monad laws
  - more Code unification
  - more erasure in Zonk: pass/compute type, immediately erase things with U/Unit type
