- Builtins:
  - Reading a Nat from terminal
  - Printing a concrete String to terminal

- JS RTS:
  - have basic pretty printer, print pretty non-closure code when doing codegen
    - Try to demangle names to get back to source code style

- Compilation:
  - more erasure in Zonk: pass/compute type, immediately erase things with U/Unit type

- Elaboration
  - definitional monad laws
  - more Code unification
  - (record unification)


- PROBLEM:
  - JS open codegen is kinda broken!!
  - Rethink stuff


RETHINK STUFF

- closed codegen is THE SAME SHIT AS THE HASKELL JS COMPILER
  - cconv:
    STATE: boundVarSet, cspArray, closureArray, fvSet, Top/Local, stage, currentTopName
  - emission:
    STATE: Open/Closed, stage, builder, indentation

- open codegen is COMPLETELY SEPARATELY IMPLEMENTED
  - quote:
    no cconv; only reads back and fills csvArray!
    STATE: boundVarSet   INHERITED from caller
           cspArray      initialized and RESTORED to caller

  - emission:
    only open emission
    STATE: stage         initialized
           builder       initialized
           indentation   initialized
