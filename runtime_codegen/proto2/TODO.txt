- Builtins:
  - Reading a Nat from terminal
  - Printing a concrete String to terminal

- JS RTS:
  - have basic pretty printer, print pretty non-closure code when doing codegen
    - Try to demangle names to get back to source code style

- Compilation:
  - more erasure in Zonk: pass/compute type, immediately erase things with U/Unit type

- Elaboration
  - definitional monad laws
  - more Code unification
  - (record unification)


- PROBLEM:
  open eval JS should need a fresh var supply being passed!!!
  we need to ensure that open codegen doesn't shadow open free vars!!!
