Here is an attempt at semantics for the "iterated internal presheaves" type theory proposed by András.

We have the graph ω of finite ordinals.
Its morphisms are
  step_n : n → n+1
for n ∈ ℕ.

Below, we consider presheaves Psh(ω) over the graph ω.
For certain constructions, we may have to restrict the values to sets with decidable equality.

Remark.
If we want to mirror the syntax, we can restrict to finite sets.
Note that Psh_fin(ω)^op is the free category with:
* a sort Var,
* a locally representable sort T(v) for v : 1 ⊔ Var,
* an operation T(v) → Var.
[Can this be simplified?]
∎

We write
  Dep : Psh(ω) → Graph
for the graph of elements functor.
Explicitly, Dep(V) has:
* objects given by n ∈ ℕ (implicit) and v ∈ V(n),
* for each v ∈ V_{n+1}, a map step_v : v → v step_n.

Remark.
We can describe Dep also in terms of the category ω.
We have a functor Lin : ω → Graph:
* sending n to the linear graph [n] = {0 → … → n},
* with functorial action given by initial segment inclusions.
Then Dep is the cocontinuous extension of Lin.
∎

A context is a pair (V, D) of:
* a presheaf V : Psh(ω) of category-level variables,
* a diagram D : Dep(V)^op → Cat
such that:
* for v ∈ V_{n+1}, the functor D_v → D_{v step} is a cartesian fibration.

A context morphism from (V', D') to (V, D) is a pair (f, u) of:
* a map f : V → V',
* a natural transformation u : D' → D Dep(f) in [Dep(V), Cat]
such that:
* for v ∈ V_n, the map u_v : D'_v → D_{Dep(f)(v)} is a discrete fibration.

These compose in the evident way.
To do this formally, we consider
  [Dep(-)^op, Cat] : Psh(ω)^op → Cat.
The category of contexts is defined as a subcategory of the category of elements of this covariant functor.
Note that D is equivalently limit over ω of Cat with Graph-weight Lin.
That is, the previous operation is Lin-weighted limit:
  lim_ω^Lin : Psh(ω)^op → Cat.

The category of contexts interprets the following:
* a sort Var of category-level variables:
    Var(V, D) = obj(Dep(V)),
* for a category level v : Var, a sort Psh(v) of presheaves:
    Psh(V, D, v) = Psh(D(v)),
* for such a presheaf A : Psh(v), a locally representable sort El(A) of elements:
    El(V, D, v, A) = Section(A) (*),
* extensional type formers for level v as usual,
* for a level-v category D, a locally representable sort Internally(D):
    Internally(V, D, v ∈ V(n))
  is the set of v' with a map f : v → v' in Dep(V) such that D(f) : D(v') → D(v)
  is strictly equal to the cartesian fibration corresponding to the category D
  internal to Psh(D(v)),
* for x : Internally(D), a category-level variable var(x) : Var:
    var(V, D, v, D, v') = v'.

We justify local representability of El.
At context (V, D) and v ∈ V(n) and A ∈ Psh(D(v)), the local representation of El(A) is given by
  (id, u) : (V, D') → (V, D).
Here, u : D' → D is obtained from D by extending with weakenings of A at all variables reachable from v.

More systematically, this goes as follows.
Write Cat_df for the restriction of Cat to discrete fibrations.
We have a functor
  U : ∫ Var ---> Cat_df
sending a context (V, D) with v ∈ V(n) to D(v).
The category Cat_df interprets extensional type theory (up to issues of splitting type formers up to isomorphism, see remark below).
The sort Psh(v) and locally representable sort El(A) for A : Psh(v) and extensional type formers at level v are all created by U.
To see this, we note that U is a cartesian fibration.
Cartesian lifts are given by not touching the variables component and:
* keeping D(v') unchanged if v does not reach v',
* otherwise using iterated cartesian lifting using the cartesian fibrations of D.

We justify local representability of Internally.
At context (V, D) and v ∈ V(n) and D a category internal to Psh(D(v)), the local representation of Internally(D) is given by
  (f, u) : (V', D') → (V, D)
where f : V → V' is the extension of V with a new variable v' over v.
Then D' is D with D'(v') → D'(v) the cartesian fibration corresponding to D.
[TODO: do formally.]

Remark.
We have a splitting issue in Cat_df.
Type formers such as Π and U are stable under base change along a discrete fibration only up to isomorphism.
To fix this without resorting to a coherence method, it seems we need to keep track separately of element extension and category extension.
So we would separate the category D(v) (standing for a category of elements) into a category D(v) and a presheaf X(v) ∈ Psh(D(v)).
The step maps become cartesian fibrations D(v') → ∫ X.
For splitting purposes, these need to be strictly presented by pseudofunctors Y(v') : (∫ X)^op → Cat.
[TODO: I don't see why these have to be strict functors?]
The morphisms in Ctx are rectified so that they are identities instead of just isomorphisms on Y, only acting on X.

For a path
  v_0 → v_1 → … → v_n
for v_n ∈ V(n), we can then interpret for example the universe in level v as follows.
Fix A_k ∈ D(v_k) with x_k ∈ X(A_k) for k ≤ n.
Let B_{k+1} ∈ Y(v_k)(A_k, x_k) correspond to A_{k+1}.
We define
  U(A_0, x_0, A_1, x_1, …, A_n, x_n)
using the following quantifications:
* over f_0 : A_0' → A_0 in D(v_0),
* for k < n, over g_{k+1} : B_{k+1}' → Y(v_k)(f_k)(B_{k+1}) in Y(v_k)(A_k', x_k f_k)
* where f_{k+1} : A_{k+1}' → A_{k+1} is the map in D(v_{k+1}) corresponding to the map (f_k, g_{k+1}) in ∫ Y(v_{k+1)).
This only depends on X and Y, not on D.
Since the quantifications are over Y and morphisms leave Y alone, everything is strictly stable.
